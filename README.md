This app is being written as an assignment for the online Android programming course offered by Udacity.

To get it to work on your own machine, you will need to generate and use your own api key for calls to [The Movie Database] (https://www.themoviedb.org/).

To do so, sign up for an account at the link above to get your own API key.
Then add a gradle.properties file in the root directory with the line:
TMDbAPIKey="<your api key here>"
